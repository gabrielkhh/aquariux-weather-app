## Important Information
This proxy express server was created to communicate with openweathermap.org purely to obfuscate the API key from appearing in the client network requests as openweathermap uses URL params to check for API keys.

In real production use cases, I'll personally use things like NextJS API if using NextJS as part of the tech stack or Serverless functions in the cloud.
